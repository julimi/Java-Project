Snake:
	1. Description of the game:
		- The fix game screen (800 X 600) displays a snake (a chain of points) always in motion and a fruit (point) on the screen.
		- The direction of the snake can be controlled by the keys.
		- The snake eats the fruit can make itself grow length and get the score
		- As the snake eats one fruit, another fruit instantly appears at a random point on the screen.
		- The snake can die by eating itself or by hitting the bounds (in the hard level, it can die by hit the walls).
		- User can determine the range of FPS (25 to 60) and speed (1 to 10) by passing the arguments: (make run will run default FPS 25 and speed 8)
			- e.g. make ARGS='25 8' run, which means you set the FPS as 25 and speed as 8
